## **Overview of the Project**

### This project will perform a bike trip analysis with the dataset collected in August 2019. The following data transformation and visualization will be prepared for this project.

- **Transform the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype.**

- **Create visualization(s) to show the length of time bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.**

- **Create visualization(s) to show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.**

- **Create visualization(s) to show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.**

- **Create visualization(s) to show the bike usage for each type of customer.**

- **Create visualization(s) to show the top starting locations.**

- **The map of the Top Starting Location demonstrates the major starting points in the city. From this map, we can see that most bike trips started from midtown and lower Manhattan.**
  
## **Summary**

- **Conclusion:**
  
    Based on the study of the dataset collected in August 2019, the male subscribers were the ones who used the Citi Bikes most frequently during the rush hours in a week. The majority of the trip duration was about 5 minutes, and the bike trips were mostly taken place in the midtown and lower Manhattan area.

- **Suggested visualizations for future analysis:**
  
  - _**Recommendation 1: Create a chart for Customers by Age by Gender.**_

  <table>
  <tr>
    <td>Customers by Age by Gender</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="PNG/Customers by Age by Gender.PNG" width=400></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
  - _**Recommendation 2: Create a chart for Bike Usage by Location by Weekday.**_

  <table>
  <tr>
    <td>Bike Usage by Location by Weekday</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="PNG/Bike Usage by Location by Weekday.PNG" width=400></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
